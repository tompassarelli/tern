# Efficient Structured Output (ESO) 1

ESO is a compact, lossless wire format for agent handoffs. It optimizes the common
shape: a small envelope plus uniform record arrays. It is UTF-8, line-oriented,
and deliberately narrower than JSON. (The reference `decode` parses a whole
document; the line-oriented grammar is amenable to streaming, but no incremental
parser ships yet.)

```eso
!eso/1
from=reviewer
to=implementer
kind=code_review
findings[2]{severity,file,line,message}
high\tsrc/auth.js\t42\ttoken never expires
medium\tsrc/api.js\t18\tmissing rate limit
meta{complete,retry}
true\tnull
```

## Grammar

```text
document = "!eso/1" LF entry*
entry    = name "=" cell LF
         | name "[" count "]" ("{" fields "}")? LF row{count}
         | name "{" fields "}" LF row
fields   = name *("," name)
row      = cell *(TAB cell) LF
name     = ALPHA / "_", then ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "." / "-"
```

- `name=value` encodes a scalar.
- `name[N]` encodes `N` scalar rows.
- `name[N]{a,b}` encodes `N` records; the schema appears once.
- `name{a,b}` encodes one record.
- Cells use JSON for `null`, booleans, numbers, arrays, objects, empty strings,
  ambiguous strings, or strings containing tabs/newlines. Other strings are bare.
- The root is an object. Names are unique. Record rows must have exactly the
  declared fields, in order. Counts are checksums: truncated or extra rows fail.
- An empty object is `name{}` followed by one empty line; an empty array is
  `name[0]` with no rows. Both round-trip.
- Names must match the grammar above. Keys with spaces or non-ASCII characters are
  rejected at encode time, not escaped — ESO assumes code-controlled identifiers.
- Numbers are finite JSON numbers. Negative zero collapses to `0` inside nested JSON
  cells, matching `JSON.stringify`; ESO inherits JSON's number semantics. Duplicate
  names/fields and mixed record schemas are invalid.
- Integers outside the safe `Number` range (`> 2^53−1`) round-trip losslessly:
  `BigInt` encodes to bare digits, and integer literals beyond the safe range decode
  to `BigInt` rather than being corrupted by `Number()`. Safe-range integers decode to
  `Number`. `BigInt` nested inside a JSON cell is rejected — keep large ids as
  top-level fields or record fields.

## Agent Contract

Use `from`, `to`, `kind`, and `id` when routing matters. Put repeated work items in
record arrays. A record array carries one schema, so a heterogeneous batch (mixed
message/event types) must be split into one array per type, not packed into a single
array. Keep auth, money, migrations, deletion, and other irreversible instructions in
JSON validated against an application schema; compactness is not worth an ambiguous
high-impact action.

ESO does not replace JSON for public APIs, deeply nested data, signatures, or
untrusted input. Version changes require a new header such as `!eso/2`.
